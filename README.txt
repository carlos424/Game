Running the game should require the user to launch the provided .exe
Once the game is launched, the user can select between two mini games(scenes)
For both of these games, simply click on either of the boxes to play them.
Once in the game, you can move the character using the W,A,S,D keys or the Arrow keys to move.
The roll a ball game requires the player to collect all the pills. 
The Sheep game requires the player to herd the sheep into the north most pen.

Assignment 1
My First Game
The game I have developed is a small game which as two scenes which each are their own mini game. 
The first scene is the roll a ball game which the player collects some pills in order to win. 
This game I followed the tutorial that was provided and used some textures from the standard assets to make my game more unique.

The second game the player controls a box, who acts as a sheepard. 
The player has 3 sheep in the game which he needs to herd into the north most box, which is their pen. 
The sheep are rather elusive and will try to run around the player to avoid going into their pen. 
I used some assets from the asset store so I could differentiate the player, the walls, and the sheep.

I learned a lot about game design making this game. 
There was a lot of tinkering around with the AI regarding my sheep. 
I spent a lot of time on the Unity API as well in order to help grasp some of the concepts and functions that unity can provide. 
AI is a lot more complicated than I anticipated, and it was a major part of why I’m proud of my game.
 I contributed putting together most of my scripts on my own and using the Unity API. 
After from the Roll a Ball tutorial, I was able to further grasp how I can control players and NPCs within my game. 
I had some problems using the API to develop the scene transitions between my menus, but I was able to work those out. 
I hope for my final project I can learn even more about making transitions smoother, better gameplay, replay-ability, and learn as much as I can.
